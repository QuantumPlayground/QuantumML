    "### Dirac Notation\n",
    "Qubits are the fundamental units of quantum information. Unlike classical bits ($0$ or $1$), qubits can be in a superposition of both 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the quantum state, we use Dirac notation: $|0\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad |1\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is represented as $|\\psi\\rangle = α|0\\rangle + β|1\\rangle$, where α and β are complex numbers that satisfy $|\\alpha |^2 + | \\beta |^2 = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits can also become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is dependent on another, even at a distance. Measuring a qubit collapses its superposition to either $0$ or $1$, with probabilities given by $| \\alpha |^2$ and $| \\beta |^2$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $|\\psi\\rangle$, the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ form an orthonormal basis. $|\\psi\\rangle$ can be expressed as: $|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are called probability amplitudes."

    "Quantum states are exhaustive: making an observation guarantees that you will observe a quantum state.\n",

    "Since quantum states are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, the sum of their probabilities must add to 1."

    "\n",
    "Qubits can be manifested and practically applied in many ways and there are several different quantum computer design methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use an electron as a qubit, for example, encoding data based on its energy state (ground/excited).\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also use photon polarizations or nuclear spin in a magnetic field to create cubits."
